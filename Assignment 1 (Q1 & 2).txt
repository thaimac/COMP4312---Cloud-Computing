1. SaaS - Software as a Service - allows users to use apps supplied by the service provider in a cloud infrastructure. These users don't manage or control the underlying
cloud infrastructure, however. Not suitable for apps that require real-time response or those for which data is not allowed to be hosted externally. ex. Google Apps

   PaaS - Platform as a Service - allows users to deploy consumer-created or acquired apps using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. In this service,
the user has control over the deployed apps and possibly even over the app hosting environment conditions. Not suitable when the app must be portable, when proprietary 
programming languages are used, or when the underlying hardware amd/or software must be customizable. ex. Heroku 

   IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service - provides the capability to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources. The user does not
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over OS, storage, deployed apps, and possibly limited control of some networking components such as 
host firewalls. ex. DigitalOcean 

2. Grid computing involves operating on a distributed system consisting of a large number of loosely coupled, heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed systems in different
administrative domains. Cloud computing, on the other hand, typically operates on centralized homogenous architecture and is more flexible than grid computing.
